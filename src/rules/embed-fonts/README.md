## Notifies if any non-system font is not embedded in the document

In the Natural Design System embedded fonts are preferred. This is to ensure future work on the theme file even if the font is not present on the user's system. [Read more about embedding fonts in Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/docs/text/#embedding-fonts).

## Configuration

```js
{
  "active": true,
}
```
